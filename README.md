## Technologies used
- Gatsby
- GraphQL
- Sass
- Contentful CMS

Why these? Well not many reasons as this page could be created using normal HTML with a bit of JS and CSS.
I just wanted to learn how to properly use _Gatsby_ with GraphQL.  
This is also meant to be a platform for showcasing my future projects, hence integration with _Contentful CMS_ to pull new pages with project descriptions.  
I used _SASS_ for the styling because less brackets and nesting.
